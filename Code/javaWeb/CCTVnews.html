            As a landmark project for the comprehensive protection of the Yangtze River, the decade-long
            fishing ban in the Yangtze River has entered its fourth year this year. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed
            out
            that the fishing ban in the Yangtze River is an important decision made for the overall situation and for
            future
            generations. Keeping in mind the General Secretary's instructions, provinces and cities along the Yangtze
            River
            continue to promote the restoration of aquatic biodiversity in the Yangtze River and strive to ensure
            employment
            and livelihood for fishermen who have retired from fishing. During this period, reporters went deep into
            both
            banks of the Yangtze River to record the significant phased achievements of the fishing ban work and the
            solid
            actions of the majority of cadres and masses to unswervingly promote the decade-long fishing ban in the
            Yangtze
            River.
        </p>
        <p>
            Walking along the Yangtze River, researchers have discovered many encouraging phenomena.

            In the southern source of the Yangtze River, a new habitat for the small-headed naked carp has been
            discovered,
            with a population of over 30,000 fish, providing valuable data for aquatic ecological protection.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, tracking shows that the successful sea entry rate of
            artificially
            bred and released Chinese sturgeon has increased from about 45% to over 60%; the trend of miniaturization
            and
            low-age fish in Poyang Lake has been curbed, and the survival environment of habitats has been improved.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, since March this year, a large-scale migration of wild Chinese
            mitten
            crabs has been observed for the first time at the mouth of the Qinhuai River in Nanjing, with a significant
            increase in population.

            The recovery of aquatic biological resources has improved, witnessing the phased achievements of the
            decade-long
            fishing ban in the Yangtze River over the past three years.
        </p>
        <p>
            The implementation of the decade-long fishing ban in the Yangtze River is an important decision made by the
            Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, based on the long-term interests of the Chinese
            nation. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the General Secretary has
            conducted
            multiple inspections and research along the Yangtze River, gaining a detailed understanding of the
            implementation of the decade-long fishing ban. He pointed out that the fishing ban must be firmly promoted
            and
            the achievements already made must be consolidated.
        </p>

        <p>
            According to the deployment, starting from January 1, 2021, a ten-year fishing ban has been implemented in
            the
            main stream of the Yangtze River, large lakes connected to the river, important tributaries, and some sea
            areas
            at the mouth of the Yangtze River, prohibiting the productive fishing of natural fishery resources
            throughout
            the year. More than three years into the fishing ban, relevant assessments show that the aquatic biological
            integrity index of the main stream of the Yangtze River, Poyang Lake, and Dongting Lake has improved by two
            levels from the worst "no fish" before the ban. In 2022, the number of Yangtze River finless porpoises
            reached
            1,249, achieving a historic halt in decline and a rebound. The water quality of the main stream of the
            Yangtze
            River has remained at Class II for four consecutive years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Implementing the decade-long fishing ban in the Yangtze River and addressing the production and living
            issues of
            fishermen who have retired from fishing are essential for a stable and solid social foundation for the
            fishing
            ban.

            More than 30,000 fishermen in Anhui who have retired from fishing and transitioned to other industries have
            received employment training under government guidance. In Dangtu County, they learn aquaculture techniques
            for
            free, and farming ecological crabs has become a new choice for retired fishermen.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Yueyang, Hunan, which has more than 60% of the water area of Dongting Lake, the government has helped
            fishermen who have come ashore to build farms, develop the dried fish industry, and also led them to learn
            live
            streaming sales to expand sales channels.
        </p>
        <p>
            On Tangyin Island in Poyang Lake, where fishermen have retired from fishing and come ashore, the local area
            is
            exploring the development of the tourism industry by planning and utilizing unique natural resources while
            continuing to protect the ecology. Over the more than three years of the fishing ban, relevant departments
            have
            established individual records for 231,000 retired fishermen, improving employment and social security
            levels
            through multiple channels.

        <p>
            Since the implementation of the decade-long fishing ban in the Yangtze River, the provinces and cities along
            the
            river have worked together with persistent efforts, continuously advancing the protection of the Yangtze
            River
            and consolidating the achievements of the fishing ban. Next, the provinces and cities along the river will
            strengthen the restoration of important aquatic biological habitats, establish dynamic and precise support
            services for retired fishermen, improve cross-regional and cross-departmental law enforcement cooperation
            mechanisms, and ensure that the clear waters of the Yangtze River continue to benefit future generations and
            the
            people.
